### Why Incorporating Gamification into Learning is Beneficial üéÆ‚ú®

For this first post, we want to introduce ourselves and share the reasoning behind why we are creating courses with a focus on gamification. The online education landscape is facing a significant challenge: only [about 3%](https://www.insidehighered.com/digital-learning/article/2019/01/16/study-offers-data-show-moocs-didnt-achieve-their-goals) of people actually finish the courses they purchase or start. This low completion rate underscores a critical issue‚Äîtraditional video courses struggle to engage and retain the majority of learners. The fact that people often celebrate on social media when they finally complete an online course üéâ highlights the need for a new approach to learning, one that not only educates but also captivates and motivates students to complete their learning journeys.

### The Journey to Gamified Learning üöÄ

About a year and a half ago, our team began developing a Python curriculum with the goal of teaching Python from first principles. As the course evolved, it transformed significantly, incorporating interactive, gamified, and practical elements. This evolution opened our eyes to the potential of gamification in education, leading us to focus on creating engaging and effective learning experiences.

Today, we are excited to introduce our first course, specifically designed to teach AI engineering skills to software developers. This is a field that we are passionate about, and we are eager to share our knowledge in a way that truly resonates with learners.

### The Value of Gamification üïπÔ∏è

Our team is committed to creating courses that learners will not only complete but will also genuinely enjoy and learn from. We aim to develop practical, scenario-based, gamified courses that go beyond traditional video lessons. These courses are designed to provide a rich learning experience that can be directly applied in real-world careers.

Since 2017, our team has been exploring the science and art of gamification, gathering insights on how to use game mechanics to inspire and drive learners. With a team of experienced educators, we are dedicated to integrating these principles into our courses, making learning both effective and enjoyable.

### Choose Your Own Adventure üéØ

One of the unique features of our courses is the ability for students to choose their own learning path. We offer two distinct themes to cater to different learning preferences:

**Light Theme**: This path provides a low-stress, enjoyable learning experience in a supportive environment, guided by a friendly boss.

**Dark Theme**: This more challenging path introduces higher stakes, with elements such as the possibility of getting ‚Äúlaid off‚Äù if a quiz is failed. This path is designed for those who thrive under pressure and enjoy a more intense learning experience.

### The Power of Storytelling and Immersion üé•

Our courses go beyond traditional lessons by offering an immersive storytelling experience. Learners become characters with specific missions, mirroring real-world scenarios and providing practical experience in a simulated environment. This approach brings learners as close to real-world application as possible in an online course.

### Our First Course: AI APIs for Software Developers üíª

Our inaugural course focuses on AI APIs for software developers. It is designed to teach essential concepts while providing hands-on experience in real-world contexts. Students will work on projects that reflect actual industry challenges, gaining skills that are immediately applicable to their careers.
